Stay focused on work when you want, and goof off when you don't. Concentration is a simple
Python 3 console utility to block distracting sites when you need to focus, while allowing you to easily
take timed breaks. Concentration uses the /etc/hosts file as the mechanism to
block sites, and works on Linux, Macintosh, and Windows.

![Concentration Example](https://raw.github.com/timothycrosley/concentration/main/example.gif)


Installing Concentration
============================

    pip3 install concentration

Or, if pip is already set to use Python 3

    pip install concentration

Or, if you wanted concentration installed and ran in an isolated environment, consider using [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx):

    pipx run concentration


Using Concentration
============================

To keep focused (blocking distracting sites):

    sudo concentration improve

To take a small 5 minute timed break:

    sudo concentration break

To take a long 60 minute timed break:

    sudo concentration break -m 60

You can cancel breaks with `Ctrl-C`.

To disable blocking until you explicitly enable it again:

    sudo concentration lose


Configuring Concentration
============================

You can add more files to the blocked list by putting them in the following files (new line delimited):
- ~/.concentration.distractors
- /etc/concentration.distractors


You can make sure sites are visible even if concentration is enabled by putting them in the following files (new line delimited):
- ~/.concentration.safe
- /etc/concentration.safe

Thanks and I hope you find concentration useful in your effort to get more done!
