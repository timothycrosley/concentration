In the future you'll always stay focused on work, never straying of crouse. The future is now.
Stay focused on work when you want, and goof off when you don't. Concentration is a simple
console utility to block distracting sites when you need to focus, while allowing you to easily
take timed breaks.


Installing Concentration
============================

    pip install concentration


Using Concentration
============================

To keep focused (blocking distracting sites):

    sudo concentration improve

To take a small one minute timed break:

    sudo concentration break

To access all sites:

    sudo concentration lose


Configuring Concentration
============================

You can add more files to the blocked list by putting them in the following files (new line delimited):
- ~/.concentration.distractors
- /etc/concentration.distractors


--------------------------------------------

Thanks and I hope you find concentration useful in your effort to get more done!
