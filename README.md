Concentration
============================

Stay focused on work when you want, and goof off when you don't. Concentration is a simple
console utility to block distracting sites when you need to focus, while allowing you to easily
take timed breaks.


Installing Concentration
============================

    pip install concentration


Using Concentration
============================

To keep focused (blocking distracting sites):

    sudo concentration improve

To take a small one minute timed break:

    sudo concentration break

To access all sites:

    sudo concentration lose


Configuring Concentration
============================

You can add more files to the blocked list by putting them in the following files (new line delimited):
- ~/.concentration.distractors
- /etc/concentration.distractors


--------------------------------------------

Thanks and I hope you find concentration useful in your effort to get more done!
